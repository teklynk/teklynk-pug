    p Years ago, I bought a macro keypad from AliExpress. I'd seen these little gadgets on various sites, and their potential for custom shortcuts and automations immediately intrigued me. For just $20, I got a generic 12-button, 2-knob keypad with no branding or model number.
    p My excitement quickly faded when I plugged it in. The keys were mapped to a strange, seemingly random set of combinations. The seller provided a link to a configuration tool, but it was a Windows-only program with an interface that appeared to be in Chinese. As a Linux user, this was a dead end. Defeated, I tossed the keypad on a shelf, where it collected dust for a few years.
    p Recently, I stumbled upon a game-changing project on GitHub: #[a(href="https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool", target="_blank") ch57x-keyboard-tool]. This open-source tool allows you to flash custom firmware onto these generic CH57x-based keypads. Configuration is done through a simple YAML file, giving you complete control over keybinds and macros. Finally, I could unlock the keypad's true potential.

    p I created the following `config.yml` to define my desired layout.

    div.shadow-sm 
        pre.line-numbers
            code.language-yaml.
                orientation: normal

                rows: 3
                columns: 4
                knobs: 2

                layers:
                    - buttons:
                        - ["win-alt-1", "win-alt-2", "win-alt-3", "win-alt-4"]
                        - ["win-alt-5", "win-alt-6", "win-alt-7", "win-alt-8"]
                        - ["win-alt-9", "win-alt-0", "win-alt-minus", "win-alt-equal"]
                    knobs:
                        - ccw: 'volumedown'
                          press: 'mute'
                          cw: 'volumeup'
                        - ccw: 'ctrl-wheeldown'
                          press: 'ctrl-0'
                          cw: 'ctrl-wheelup'

    p As you can see in the configuration, each button is mapped to a unique key combination, like `win-alt-1`, `win-alt-2`, and so on (easy to remember). I configured the two rotary knobs to control system volume and application zoom, which are two of my most frequent adjustments.

    p With the keypad now sending custom key combinations, the next step was to make them do something useful. My operating system, Linux Mint, has a built-in tool for creating custom keyboard shortcuts (Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts). I could easily map `win-alt-1` to execute a specific command or bash script.

    p While this worked perfectly, it had a major drawback: portability. If I moved the keypad to another computer, I would have to manually recreate all the shortcuts. I wanted a more portable solution—a self-contained set of scripts and configurations that I could easily deploy on any machine with a simple `git clone`.

    p This led me to my final solution: a custom hotkey listener. I decided to write a Python script that would run in the background, listen for my specific key combinations (`win-alt-1`, `win-alt-2`, etc.), and execute commands accordingly.

    p The result is #[a(href="https://github.com/teklynk/hotkey_listener", target="_blank") hotkey_listener], a Python script that uses a simple JSON file to map key combinations to shell commands.

    p The JSON config file is pretty simple. (pynput uses "cmd" instead of "win")

    div.shadow-sm 
        pre.line-numbers
            code.language-json.
                [
                    {
                        "keys": ["cmd", "alt", "1"],
                        "command": "bash /home/user/scripts/myscript1.sh"
                    },
                    {
                        "keys": ["cmd", "alt", "2"],
                        "command": "bash /home/user/scripts/myscript2.sh"
                    },
                    {
                        "keys": ["cmd", "alt", "3"],
                        "command": "bash /home/user/scripts/myscript3.sh"
                    },
                    {
                        "keys": ["cmd", "alt", "4"],
                        "command": "tilix --quake"
                    },
                    {
                        "keys": ["cmd", "alt", "5"],
                        "command": "xkill"
                    }
                ]

    p The JSON File is then included in the hotkey_listener.py script

                    k_lower = k.lower()
                    return SPECIAL_KEYS.get(k_lower, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char(k_lower))

                def load_hotkeys():
                    """Load hotkey mappings from JSON"""
                    with open(HOTKEY_CONFIG, "r") as f:
                        data = json.load(f)

                        keys = frozenset(parse_key(k) for k in entry["keys"])
                        hotkey_map[keys] = entry["command"]
                    return hotkey_map

                hotkeys = load_hotkeys()
                pressed_keys = set()

                def on_press(key):
                    pressed_keys.add(key)
                    for combo, command in hotkeys.items():
                        if combo.issubset(pressed_keys):

                def on_release(key):
                    pressed_keys.discard(key)

                print("Hotkey listener running...")
                with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
                    listener.join()

    p To make this seamless, I needed the script to launch automatically on login. I accomplished this by creating a `.desktop` entry in `~/.config/autostart/hotkey_listener.desktop`. This desktop file simply executes a `run.sh` script, which in turn starts the `hotkey_listener.py`. Now, my custom shortcuts are active as soon as I log in, on any machine where I've set up the project.

    p Here is an example `.desktop` file that I use on Linux Mint:

    div.shadow-sm 
        pre.line-numbers
            code.language-bash.
                [Desktop Entry]
                Type=Application
                Exec=/home/user/hotkey_listener/run.sh
                Hidden=false
                NoDisplay=false
                X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
                Name=Hotkey Listener
                Comment=Custom keyboard shortcut listener

    h2 My Use Case

    p So, what do I actually *do* with all this? My `hotkey.json` is configured to execute a variety of bash scripts that automate my daily workflow. I have dedicated buttons to instantly mute my microphone, toggle Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and switch my audio output between headphones and speakers—a lifesaver before a conference call.

    p To keep everything organized and portable, I added a `scripts` folder to the project. This contains all my most-used scripts, making the entire setup self-contained and easy to deploy on any machine. I also printed and glued (water based glue-stick) some labels with icons on to each of the keys. 

    p This little keypad, which once sat collecting dust on a shelf for years, has become one of my most indispensable gadgets. It's a perfect example of how a little open-source software and creativity can breathe new life into forgotten hardware. I can't imagine my desk without it.
